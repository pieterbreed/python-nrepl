# TODO

## Next milestone: nrepl-cli

**To create an `nrepl` client in python that does not rely on too many external libraries (or none at all if I can get away with it)**

 - Create a 'top-level' class with which to interact with the nrepl session
 - Have a reasonable source folder structure


## Feature list
 - Implement the suggestions on [this page](http://infinitemonkeycorps.net/docs/pph/)
