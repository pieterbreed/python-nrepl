python-nrepl
============

python client for clojure nrepl

This is still a work in progress, it's not feature-complete, it's not even 'feature'.

What it will hopefully be at some point in the future, after enough insomnic nights or
wife-away-from-home-on-business trips, is a python client that can connect to and 
interact with a clojure nrepl.

The ultimate goal for this is to be a plugin in Sublime Text 2 (and maybe 3) because you
know, emacs sucks. (yes, I said it)
